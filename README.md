# SWAM speak-chat

StarMash extension to speak chat messages with text to speech.

Reading the chat while getting shot at can be difficult. Having the chat
read aloud gives you one less thing to worry about. 

### Mod Settings
- Enable/disable speech
- Speech speed
- Voice selection for multiple languages (not working in chrome/edge)

## Status
All the important things are working but a couple bugs still exist. Pull
requests and new issues are welcome!
